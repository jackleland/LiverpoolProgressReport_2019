abstract = {{\~{}}T was suggested a few years ago by Sir J. J. Thomson' that certain phenomena of electrical discharge could be explained by what we may call ionization by repeated impact. He had found that luminous discharge could be produced from a cathode of hot CaO with potential differences much smaller than those which are needed when a cold cathode is used, and that at a certain critical point it needed but a very small increase in the voltage to produce a large increase in the current and to change from the non-luminous to a luminous form of discharge. He believed that the ionization in the luminous form of discharge was not due to the breaking up of an atom by a single impact with an electron, but rather to an explosion of the atom because of its having absorbed so much internal energy from repeated impacts with electrons that its equilibrium had become unstable. If this idea is correct, it is important not only because it explains this particular phenomenon, but also because it offers an explana-tion of the ionization of the arc and gives us some information concerning the character of the atom. I have, therefore, given some study to the subject, but find that there are several reasons for rejecting this explanation. Improbability of Repeated Impacts. — The first of these objections is that there are far too few electrons present in the tube at any time before the discharge becomes luminous to occasion repeated impacts. For example, in one experiment performed by myself the largest current that could be passed through the tube without having a luminous discharge was 5XIo ' ampere, which is I5o electrostatic units. The charge carried by each ion' is 3.{\$})(IQ ". The cross section of the tube used was approximately 5 sq. cm.

abstract = {HEN a carbon or metal filament is heated in a vacuum and sur-rounded by a positively charged metal cylinder, it is we11 known that electrons are given off by the hot solid. This effect in lamps has been commonly known as the Edison effect and has been rather fully described in the case of carbon lamps by Fleming. ' Richardson and others have studied quantitatively the ionization produced by hot solids, especially from heated platinum, and have col-lected a large amount of data. It has generally been found that the saturation current is independent of the pressure of the gas and increases rapidly with increasing temperature of the filament. However, certain gases were found to have very marked effects; for example, traces of hydrogen were. found to enormously increase the saturation current obtained from hot platinum. ' Recent investigations have shown' that at least in some cases the current is due to secondary chemical effects. Pring and Parker4 showed that the current obtained from incandescent carbon could be cut down to very small values by progressive purification of the carbon and improvement of the vacuum. They conclude that "the large currents hitherto obtained with heated carbon cannot be ascribed to the emission of electrons from carbon itself, but that they are probably due to some reaction at high temperatures between the carbon, or contained impurities, and the surrounding gases, which involves the emission of electrons. " Pring and Parker observed also that the ioni-zation (or rather thermionic current) "increased only very slightly with the temperature above Isoo'. " The eSect of these publications, together with that of Soddy, ' who noticed similar effects with a {\%}ehnelt cathode, has been to cast doubt on the existence of a thermionic current in a perfect vacuum and from pure metals.

abstract = {A route to stationary MHD stable operation at high $\beta$ N has been explored at the Joint European Torus (JET) by optimizing the current ramp-up, heating start time and the waveform of neutral beam injection (NBI) power. In these scenarios the current ramp-up has been accompanied by plasma pre-heat (or the NBI has been started before the current flat-top) and NBI power up to 22 MW has been applied during the current flat-top. In the discharges considered transient total $\beta$ N ≈ 3.3 and stationary (during high power phase) $\beta$ N ≈ 3 have been achieved by applying the feedback control of $\beta$ N with the NBI power in configurations with monotonic or flat core safety factor profile and without an internal transport barrier (ITB). The transport and current drive in this scenario is analysed here by using the TRANSP and ASTRA codes. The interpretative analysis performed with TRANSP shows that 50–70{\%} of current is driven non-inductively; half of this current is due to the bootstrap current which has a broad profile since an ITB was deliberately avoided. The GLF23 transport model predicts the temperature profiles within a ±22{\%} discrepancy with the measurements over the explored parameter space. Predictive simulations with this model show that the E × B rotational shear plays an important role for thermal ion transport in this scenario, producing up to a 40{\%} increase of the ion temperature. By applying transport and current drive models validated in self-consistent simulations of given reference scenarios in a wider parameter space, the requirements for fully non-inductive stationary operation at JET are estimated. It is shown that the strong stiffness of the temperature profiles predicted by the GLF23 model restricts the bootstrap current at larger heating power. In this situation full non-inductive operation without an ITB can be rather expensive strongly relying on the external non-inductive current drive sources.},

@article{Tonks1929,
abstract = {The conception of random positive ion velocities corresponding to ion temperatures in a plasma has serious theoretical difficulties and is lacking in direct experimental verification. It is more reasonable to assume that each ion starts from rest and subsequently possesses only the velocity which it acquires by falling through a static electric field which is itself maintained by the balance of electron and ion charges. This new viewpoint thus ascribes motions to the positive ions which, for long free paths, are ordered rather than chaotic, each negative body in contact with the discharge collecting ions from a definite region of the plasma and from it only. The resulting integral the plasma-sheath potential distribution have been set up for plane, cylindrical, and spherical plasmas, for long, short and intermediate length ion free paths, and for both constant rate of ionization throughout the plasma and rate proportional to electron density, and these equations have been solved for the potential distribution in the plasma in all important cases. The case of short ion free paths in a cylinder with ion generation proportional to electron density gives the same potential distribution as found for the positive column by Schottky using his ambipolar diffusion theory, with the advantages that ambipolarity and quasineutrality need not appear as postulates. The calculated potential distribution agrees with that found experimentally. The potential difference between center and edge of plasma approximates Te 11,600 volts in all long ion free path cases. The theory yields two equations. One, the ion current equation, simply equates the total number of ions reaching the discharge tube wall to the total number of ions generated in the plasma, but it affords a new method of calculating the density of ionization. The second, the plasma balance equation, relates rate of ion generation, discharge tube diameter (in the cylindrical case), and electron temperature. It can be used to calculate the rate of ion generation, the resulting values checking (to order of magnitude) those calculated from one-stage ionization probabilities. The potential difference between the center of the plasma and a non-conducting bounding wall as calculated from the ion current equation agrees with that found experimentally.},

abstract = {Knowing the ion temperature in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of tokamaks is of great importance for understanding the heat flux to plasma facing components. Few measurements are available for SOL ion temperatures compared with electron temperatures due to the relative complexity of the measurement. Two retarding field energy analysers (RFEAs) have been used in the mega amp spherical tokamak (MAST) to measure the ion temperature at both the midplane and the divertor in ohmic L-mode plasmas with a range of densities. Midplane SOL T-i was found to be higher than T-e by a factor of about 2 or greater. Divertor T-i measurements at the target showed T-i approximate to T-e having considered the effect of plasma flows on the divertor RFEA measurements.},

abstract = {In this contribution, we report on experiments performed in MAST to investigate dust creation, transport and influence on plasma performance. The exceptional diagnostic access of MAST allows stereoscopic imaging of dust particles' motion in both the divertor and the main chamber, utilizing fast infrared cameras. This technique allows the 3D trajectory of the particles to be reconstructed. Infrared imaging of dust creation during disruptions revealed an isotropic release of dust particles from the surface with very high velocities (up to 350ms−1). Stereoscopic imaging has been used to study, for the first time, the mobilization and transport in the divertor plasmas of carbon and tungsten particles with known size distributions, which were introduced into the vessel through a divertor probe. A correlation between the carbon particle size and acceleration by the plasma is observed. Tungsten particles are found to move with lower velocities and experience lower acceleration and are found to be more prone to vertical motion towards the core plasma. In the case of large particles this can lead to early disruptions. Modelling of the dust injection experiments has been conducted using the DTOKS code in an attempt to validate the transport equations employed in the simulation.},

It develops from first principles the concepts needed to plan, execute, and interpret plasma diagnostics. The book is therefore accessible to graduate students and professionals with little specific plasma physics background, but is also a valuable reference for seasoned plasma physicists. Most of the examples are taken from laboratory plasma research, but the focus on principles makes the treatment useful to all experimental and theoretical plasma physicists, including those interested in space and astrophysical applications. This second edition is thoroughly revised and updated, with new sections and chapters covering recent developments in the field. Specific areas of added coverage include neutral-beam-based diagnostics, flow measurement with mach probes, equilibrium of strongly shaped plasmas and fusion product diagnostics.},

It is shown that when the magnetic field applied is very weak and the electrons reach the probe without collisions in the probe sheath the second-derivative Druyvesteyn formula can be used for EEDF evaluation. At low values of the magnetic field, an extended second-derivative Druyvesteyn formula yields reliable results, while at higher values of the magnetic field, the first-derivative probe technique is applicable for precise evaluation of the plasma potential and the EEDF. There is an interval of intermediate values of the magnetic field when both techniques—the extended second-derivative and the first-derivative one—can be used. Experimental results from probe measurements in different ranges of magnetic field are reviewed and discussed: low-pressure argon gas discharges in the presence of a magnetic field in the range from 0.01 to 0.08 T, probe measurements in circular hydrogen plasmas for high-temperature fusion (magnetic fields from 0.45 T to 1.3 T) in small ISTTOK and CASTOR tokamaks, D-shape COMPASS tokamak plasmas, as well as in the TJ-II stellarator. In the vicinity of the last closed flux surface (LCFS) in tokamaks and in the TJ-II stellarator, the EEDF obtained is found to be bi-Maxwellian, while close to the tokamak chamber wall it is Maxwellian. The mechanism of the appearance of a bi-Maxwellian EEDF in the vicinity of the LCFS is discussed. Comparison of the results from probe measurements with those obtained from calculations using the ASTRA and EIRENE codes shows that the main reason for the appearance of a bi-Maxwellian EEDF in the vicinity of the LCFS is the ionization of the neutral atoms.},

abstract = {The Super-X Divertor (SXD), a robust axisymmetric redesign of the divertor magnetic geometry that can allow a fivefold increase in the core power density of toroidal fusion devices, is presented. With small changes in poloidal coils and currents for standard divertors, the SXD allows the largest divertor plate radius inside toroidal field coils. This increases the plasma-wetted area by 2-3 times over all flux-expansion-only methods (e.g., plate near main X point, plate tilting, X divertor, and snowflake), decreases parallel heat flux and hence plasma temperature at plate, and increases connection length by 2-5 times. Examples of high-power-density fusion devices enabled by SXD are discussed; the most promising near-term device is a 100 MW modular compact fusion neutron source "battery" small enough to fit inside a conventional fission blanket.},

Hazarika et al -This content was downloaded from IP address 82. Abstract A Mach probe (MP) is an electric probe system to deduce the plasma flow velocity from the ratio of ion saturation currents. Generally, a typical MP is composed of two directional electric probes located at opposite sides of an insulator, which is mostly used as a parallel MP, but there are other MPs such as perpendicular MP (PMP), Gundestrup probe (GP) or rotating probe (RP), and visco-MP (VMP), depending on the shape of the probe holder, location of different probes or the method of collecting ions. For the parallel MP (to be called simply an MP), the relation between the ratio of the upstream ion saturation current density (J up) to the downstream (J dn) and the normalized drift velocity (M ∞ = v d / √ T e /m i) of the plasma has generally been fitted into an exponential form (R = J up /J dn ≈ exp[KM ∞ ]). For the GP or RP, with oblique ion collection, the relation becomes R = exp[K(M − M ⊥ cot $\theta$)], where K 2.3–2.5, M = M ∞ , M ⊥ is the normalized perpendicular flow to the magnetic field, and $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the probe surface. The normalized drift velocity of flowing plasmas is deduced from the ratio (R m) measured by an MP as M ∞ = ln[R m ]/K, where K is a calibration factor depending on the magnetic flux density, collisionality of charged particles and neutrals, viscosity of plasmas, ion temperature, etc. Existing theories of MPs in unmagnetized and magnetized flowing plasmas are introduced in terms of kinetic, fluid and particle-in-cell models or self-consistent and self-similar methods along with key physics and comments. Experimental evidence of relevant models is shown along with validity of related theories. Calibration and error analysis are also given. For probes other than the typical parallel MP, the relation between the ratio of ion saturation currents and M ∞ can be expressed as a combination of the functional forms: exponential and/or polynomial form of M ∞ for PMP; two Rs of two separate MPs for VMP. Collisions of ions/electrons/neutrals, asymmetries of ion temperatures and the existence of hyperthermal electrons, existence of ion beam, supersonic flow and negative ions can affect the deduction of flow velocities by an MP. a: radius of probe b: radius of sheath; b − a = sheath thickness A: probe area $\theta$ : angle to the probe for particle collection (= 90 • : normal incidence, = 0 • : grazing incidence) n i , n i∞ : ion number density at an arbitrary position and infinitely far from the probe, respectively n e , n e∞ : electron number density at an arbitrary position and infinitely far from the probe, respectively n, n s : normalized ion density (≡ n i /n ∞) at an arbitrary position and sheath edge, respectively n ∞ : normalized ion or electron number density out of the perturbation region since n ∞ = n e∞ = n i∞ for quasi-neutrality n st : stagnation density J : current density J ∞ : unperturbed current density (out of the perturbation region) J s : current density at the sheath edge J up,dn : upstream and downstream current density of ions at the sheath edge N in,out : number of ions entering/coming from the ion flux tube J net : net current density to the ion flux tube $\rho$ i : ion gyro-radius $\lambda$ D : Debye length $\lambda$: normalized Debye length to the probe radius x: an arbitrary position vector z: coordinate for parallel direction to the probe r: coordinate for perpendicular direction to the probe y: normalized distance to parallel perturbation length (≡ z/L ||), for a magnetized plasma, and to probe radius (≡ z/a) for an unmagnetized plasma s: dimensionless distance for non-uniform meshing (y = s $\delta$ , $\delta$ {\textgreater} 1) L || , L * || : parallel components of perturbation length expressed by a},

Langmuir probes are still one of the most commonly applied diagnostics in tokamaks but our understanding of how to interpret them in strong magnetic fields is still rather limited Recent results from flush-mounted Langmuir probes in divertor plates are used to highlight the problem areas, in particular non-saturation of the ion current and low electron to ion saturation current ratios. Tne importance of measuring the parallel flow velocity in the plasma edge is highlighted and recent developments in theories for interpretation of Mach probes are discussed. Finally, the importance of diagnostics for ion temperature and impurity content is emphasized, and progress in the application of advanced electrical probes such as retarding field analysers and mass spectrometers to the tokamak boundary is reviewed in this context.},

In principle, it is not passible to interpret a Langmuir probe in a strong magnetic field since the modelling of non-ambipolar cross-field transpon is uncenain.

By using a special pmbe with B small collecting element (pin) just in front of the principd collecting element (plate) it is possible to correct for the influence of the magnetic field, and to use simple single-probe theory to extract n, and T,. The uncenain influence of the non-ambipolar cross-field uanspan is entirely circumvenrrd.

In a strong magnetic field, there is no satisfactory theory for interpreting the current-voltage characteristic above floating potential, and so usually only the high-energy electrons in the distribution are used to deduce T e . It is shown that the value of T e extracted from the Langmuir probe characteristic in this way yields T eh , unless the hot component is extremely small. Langmuir probes therefore tend to overestimate T e in magnetically confined devices.

abstract = {Deep learning is having a profound impact in many fields, especially those that involve some form of image processing. Deep neural networks excel in turning an input image into a set of high-level features. On the other hand, tomography deals with the inverse problem of recreating an image from a number of projections. In plasma diagnostics, tomography aims at reconstructing the cross-section of the plasma from radiation measurements. This reconstruction can be computed with neural networks. However, previous attempts have focused on learning a parametric model of the plasma profile. In this work, we use a deep neural network to produce a full, pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of the plasma profile. For this purpose, we use the overview bolometer system at JET, and we introduce an up-convolutional network that has been trained and tested on a large set of sample tomograms. We show that this network is able to reproduce existing reconstructions with a high level of accuracy, as measured by several metrics.},

The phase shift is measured using heterodyne IQ-downconversion and CORDIC phase rotation enabling detection of integral electron density perturbations above 4MHz. The design is shown to be stable towards 2$\pi$-wraps beyond any rate of density change or mirror movement expected in a fusion device.

abstract = {The basic concepts of the controlled thermonuclear program at Project Matterhorn, Princeton University are discussed. In particular, the theory of confinement of a fully ionized gas in the magnetic configuration of the stellarator is given, the theories of heating are outlined, and the bearing of observational results on these theories is described.$\backslash$nMagnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a ``rotational transform,'' such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross‐sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. A theorem by Kruskal is used to prove that each line of force in such a system generates a toroidal surface; ideally the wall is such a surface. A rotational transform may be generated either by a solenoidal field in a twisted, or figure‐eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.$\backslash$nPlasma confinement in a stellarator is analyzed from both the macroscopic and the microscopic points of view. The macroscopic equations, derived with certain simplifying assumptions, are used to show the existence of an equilibrium situation, and to discuss the limitations on material pressure in these solutions. The single‐particle, or microscopic, picture shows that particles moving along the lines of force remain inside the stellarator tube to the same approximation as do the lines of force. Other particles are presumably confined by the action of the radial electric field that may be anticipated.$\backslash$nTheory predicts and observation confirms that initial breakdown, complete ionization, and heating of a hydrogen or helium gas to about 106 degrees K are possible by means of a current parallel to the magnetic field (ohmic heating). Flow of impurities from the tube walls into the heated gas, during the discharge, may be sharply reduced by use of an ultra‐high vacuum system; some improvement is also obtained with a divertor, which diverts the outer shell of magnetic flux away from the discharge. Experiments with ohmic heating verify the presence of a hydromagnetic instability predicted by Kruskal for plasma currents greater than a certain critical value and also indicate the presence of other cooperative phenomena. Heating to very much higher temperatures can be achieved by use of a pulsating magnetic field. Heating at the positive‐ion cyclotron resonance frequency has been proposed theoretically and confirmed observationally by Stix. In addition, an appreciable energy input to the positive ions should be possible, in principle, if the pulsation period is near the time between ion‐ion collisions or the time required for a positive ion to pass through the heating section (magnetic pumping).},

When ions are very strongly magnetized, they remain tied to the field lines, even inside the sheath: there is no mechanism available to allow the existence of a magnetic presheath, and the Bohm criterion only applies to the parallel velocity, not the normal velocity. There are important consequences for flush-mounted probes because the shape of the ion branch of the I-V characteristic depends on the degree of sheath magnetization, a wide range of which has been investigated by means of one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The results explain in a qualitative way the behavior of the ion current characteristics obtained using the Tokamak de Varennes (TdeV) [J. P. Gunn et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 66, 154 (1995)] flush-mounted probe system.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional particle simulations of the sheath in front of a flat Langmuir probe mounted into a particle absorbing plate are performed to study the influence of a strong magnetic field (relation between Larmor radii and Debye length) which is oriented obliquely to the probe surface. Ion-attracting probes are considered and the sheath is assumed to be collisionless. The full particle orbits in the homogeneous magnetic field and the self-consistent electric potential are calculated with a particle-in-cell (PIC) code with two spatial coordinates and three velocity components (2d,3v). The main results are: In the sheath the ion trajectories are bent towards the normal to the probe surface so that the ion flow is focused to the edges of the probe. This leads to an enhancement of the ion current as compared to the current flowing in the flux tube subtended by the probe. As a consequence the current does not saturate at large (negative) probe voltage, because the thickness of the Debye sheath, and thus the effective probe size, grows with increasing probe voltage. This effect is particularly strong if the sheath thickness is about as large, or larger than, the projection of the probe size along the magnetic field lines. These results can help to explain the ion-current non saturation found in recent measurements with Langmuir probes in the boundary layer of magnetically confined plasmas.},

A simple one-dimensional model with a Monte-Carlo procedure for Coulomb collisions is used. The SOL is collisional before the ELM, but the mean-free-path length in the hot ELM plasma is longer than the connection length, such that fast electrons can travel directly from the midplane to the target plate. However, the sheath potential increases rapidly, and most of the energy is transported with a velocity of order of the ion sound speed if secondary electron emission (SEE) is absent or weak. In the case of strong SEE, though, a large fraction of the energy can be carried by fast electrons during the ELM pulse.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of castellated plasma-facing components (PFCs) in tokamaks. Special focus is given to crossings between poloidal and toroidal gaps where elevated heat loads are expected to occur. Moreover, the crossings may affect the plasma penetration into the gaps between tiles. Both of these problems are of high importance for ITER when estimating the lifetime of its PFCs. Localized heat loads can potentially lead to damage of the tiles, while the plasma penetration is related to fuel retention in the gaps due to redeposition of eroded wall material. This problem has previously been targeted by 2D PIC simulations using our in-house code SPICE2, where toroidal and poloidal gaps (PGs) had to be simulated separately. This paper presents the results of a full 3D3V code SPICE3, which allows us to simulate a more realistic geometry of the tiles including the gap crossings and includes the complete E × B drift, which could not be simulated in 2D. The results of self-consistent simulations show that the crossing acts as a transport channel for electrons, allowing them to enter the plasma shadowed region in PGs. As a consequence, the potential near the gap entrance is modified allowing more ions to flow deep inside the gap. The combination of the plasma flow and an E × B drift in the crossing directs ions onto one tile corner, which receives elevated heat load.},

abstract = {Ion sensitive probes serve to measure the ion temperature in magnetized plasma. Such a probe typically consists of a collector submerged inside a hollow tube, which is oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The principle of the probe is based on geometrical shielding of the ion collector from plasma electrons. According to the basic theory, when the collector is retracted in the tube, electrons with their small Larmor radii should not be able to reach it and the collector becomes sensitive to ions. However, experimental results show that the electron shielding is in general inefficient, it only works in the case when the potential of the collector is the same as the potential of the inside surface of the tube. This problem is investigated using a full 3D particle-in-cell Cartesian code with a fast multigrid Poisson solver. We simulate the plasma behaviour in the vicinity of a model of the ion sensitive probe. A positive potential structure is formed at the entrance of the tube due to the space charge of ions that gyrate inside. This structure produces E × B drifts, which push electrons into the shielded space. A stream of electrons hitting the collector is observed for various potentials of the collector. Simulations revealed that electrons can penetrate inside the geometrical shadow in all studied cases; however, they do not reach the collector when the potential of the collector is equal to the potential of the tube.

It is considered that in these sources negative ions are produced by ions and atoms interacting with a caesiated surface, but this mechanism is not unique: the volume production, based on dissociative electron attachment to rovibrationally excited molecules, is also active. We suggest that in RF sources the acceleration of positive ions to a few tens of eV by the plasma potential difference between the driver and the extraction regions can have an important effect on negative ion production by enhancing the negative ion yield from caesiated surfaces, and by charge exchange reactions with caesium atoms. The presence of energetic positive ions can have other implications (modifying the virtual cathode in front of the plasma grid, participating in caesium ionization). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The existing theoretical models and reported experimental results on these two mechanisms are summarized. Performance of the negative hydrogen/deuterium ion sources that emerged from studies of these mechanisms is reviewed.

Heavy negative ions can be effectively produced by the ejection of a sputtered atom through the optimally cesiated surface of target with a low work function. Then, enough continuous negative-ion currents for materials-science applications can be obtained. We developed several kinds of sputter-type heavy negative-ion sources such as neutral- and ionized-alkaline metal bombardment-type heavy negative-ion source and rf-plasma sputter type. In the case where a negative ion is irradiated on a material surface, surface charging seldom takes place because incoming negative charge of the negative ion is well balanced with outgoing negative charge of the released secondary electron. In the negative-ion implantation into an insulator or insulated conductive material, high precision implantation processing with charge-up free properties can be achieved. Negative-ion implantation technique, therefore, can be applied to the following novel material processing systems: the surface modification of micrometer-sized powders, the nanoparticle formation in an insulator for the quantum devices, and the nerve cell growth manipulation by precise control of the biocompatibility of polymer surface. When a negative ion with low kinetic energy approaches the solid surface, the kinetic energy causes the interatomic bonding (kinetic bonding), and formation of a metastable material is promoted. Carbon films with high constituent of sp(3) bonding, therefore, can be formed by carbon negative-ion beam deposition.},

abstract = {We have developed conceptual designs of two petawatt-class pulsed-power accelerators: Z 300 and Z 800. The designs are based on an accelerator architecture that is founded on two concepts: single-stage electrical-pulse compression and impedance matching [Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 10, 030401 (2007)]. The prime power source of each machine consists of 90 linear-transformer-driver (LTD) modules. Each module comprises LTD cavities connected electrically in series, each of which is powered by 5-GW LTD bricks connected electrically in parallel. (A brick comprises a single switch and two capacitors in series.) Six water-insulated radial-transmission-line impedance transformers transport the power generated by the modules to a six-level vacuum-insulator stack. The stack serves as the accelerator's water-vacuum interface. The stack is connected to six conical outer magnetically insulated vacuum transmission lines (MITLs), which are joined in parallel at a 10-cm radius by a triple-post-hole vacuum convolute. The convolute sums the electrical currents at the outputs of the six outer MITLs, and delivers the combined current to a single short inner MITL. The inner MITL transmits the combined current to the accelerator's physics-package load. Z 300 is 35 m in diameter and stores 48 MJ of electrical energy in its LTD capacitors. The accelerator generates 320 TW of electrical power at the output of the LTD system, and delivers 48 MA in 154 ns to a magnetized-liner inertial-fusion (MagLIF) target [Phys. Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010)]. The peak electrical power at the MagLIF target is 870 TW, which is the highest power throughout the accelerator. Power amplification is accomplished by the centrally located vacuum section, which serves as an intermediate inductive-energy-storage device. The principal goal of Z 300 is to achieve thermonuclear ignition; i.e., a fusion yield that exceeds the energy transmitted by the accelerator to the liner. 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations suggest Z 300 will deliver 4.3 MJ to the liner, and achieve a yield on the order of 18 MJ. Z 800 is 52 m in diameter and stores 130 MJ. This accelerator generates 890 TW at the output of its LTD system, and delivers 65 MA in 113 ns to a MagLIF target. The peak electrical power at the MagLIF liner is 2500 TW. The principal goal of Z 800 is to achieve high-yield thermonuclear fusion; i.e., a yield that exceeds the energy initially stored by the accelerator's capacitors. 2D MHD simulations suggest Z 800 will deliver 8.0 MJ to the liner, and achieve a yield on the order of 440 MJ. Z 300 and Z 800, or variations of these accelerators, will allow the international high-energy-density-physics community to conduct advanced inertial-confinement-fusion, radiation-physics, material-physics, and laboratory-astrophysics experiments over heretofore-inaccessible parameter regimes.},

Such high convergence implosions are subject to degradation by a range of perturbations, including the growth of small-scale defects due to hydrodynamic instabilities, as well as longer scale modulations due to radiation flux asymmetries in the enclosing hohlraum. Due to the broad range of scales involved, and also the genuinely three-dimensional (3D) character of the flow, accurately modeling NIF implosions remains at the edge of current simulation capabilities. This paper describes the current state of progress of 3D capsule-only simulations of NIF implosions aimed at accurately describing the performance of specific NIF experiments.

abstract = {This Letter reports on a series of high-adiabat implosions of cryogenic layered deuterium-tritium (DT) capsules indirectly driven by a " high-foot " laser drive pulse at the National Ignition Facility. High-foot implosions have high ablation velocities and large density gradient scale lengths and are more resistant to ablation-front Rayleigh-Taylor instability induced mixing of ablator material into the DT hot spot. Indeed, the observed hot spot mix in these implosions was low and the measured neutron yields were typically 50{\%} (or higher) of the yields predicted by simulation. On one high performing shot (N130812), 1.7 MJ of laser energy at a peak power of 350 TW was used to obtain a peak hohlraum radiation temperature of ∼300 eV. The resulting experimental neutron yield was ð2.4 AE 0.05Þ × 10 15 DT, the fuel $\rho$R was ð0.86 AE 0.063Þ g=cm 2 , and the measured T ion was ð4.2 AE 0.16Þ keV, corresponding to 8 kJ of fusion yield, with ∼1=3 of the yield caused by self-heating of the fuel by $\alpha$ particles emitted in the initial reactions.

High repetition rate gain-switched Er:YAG ceramic laser at 1645 nm Abstract. The latest techniques for the fabrication of high power laser targets, using processes developed for the manufacture of Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) devices are discussed. These laser targets are designed to meet the needs of the increased shot numbers that are available in the latest design of laser facilities. Traditionally laser targets have been fabricated using conventional machining or coarse etching processes and have been produced in quantities of 10s to low 100s. Such targets can be used for high complexity experiments such as Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) studies and can have many complex components that need assembling and characterisation with high precision. Using the techniques that are common to MEMS devices and integrating these with an existing target fabrication capability we are able to manufacture and deliver targets to these systems. It also enables us to manufacture novel targets that have not been possible using other techniques. In addition, developments in the positioning systems that are required to deliver these targets to the laser focus are also required and a system to deliver the target to a focus of an F2 beam at 0.1Hz is discussed.},

abstract = {Beryllium (Be) ablator offers multiple advantages over carbon based ablators for indirectly driven NIF ICF ignition targets. These are higher mass ablation rate, ablation pressure and ablation velocity, lower capsule albedo, and higher thermal conductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Such advantages can be used to improve the target robustness and performance. While previous NIF Be target designs exist, they were obtained a long time ago and do not incorporate the latest improved physical understanding and models based upon NIF experiments. Herein, we propose a new NIF Be ignition target design at 1.45 MJ, 430 TW that takes all this knowledge into account. 1. Advantages of Be ablators and previous NIF Be target designs National Ignition Facility (NIF) is working hard towards demonstrating thermonuclear ignition and burn of millimeter size, indirectly driven, inertially confined, cryogenic deuterium-tritium (DT) capsules in a gold hohlraum. So far, NIF has primarily employed plastic-ablator (CH) capsules with germanium (Ge) or silicon (Si) dopant, although recently a number of experiments with high density carbon (HDC or " diamond ") ablators have been also carried out. Herein, we propose an alternative NIF target that employs copper (Cu) doped beryllium-ablator (Be) capsules. Be ablator offers multiple advantages over carbon-based ablators [1, 2]. Such advantages can be utilized, in particular, to significantly improve capsule robustness to instabilities [1]. In fact, overall, Be is arguably the best ablator there exists. The most important Be advantages, as demonstrated [2] both experimentally and computationally, are the mass ablation rate ˙ M a [mg/(cm 2 ns)], ablation pressure P a = C s ˙ M a [Mbar] and ablation velocity V a = ˙ M a /$\rho$ [$\mu$m/ns], which are significantly larger than those of CH and HDC. Here, C s is the sound speed in the ablated plasma and $\rho$ is the ablator mass density. Dependences of ˙ M a , P a and V a on ablator material properties can be understood by considering propagation of a thermal wave that carries heat into the ablator by the radiation heat conduction mechanism [3] and are given by ˙ M a ∝ A i 1 + Z i T 3 r $\kappa$ R ($\rho$, T r) , P a ∝ T 2 r $\kappa$ R ($\rho$, T r) , V a ∝ A i 1 + Z i T 3 r $\rho$ 2 $\kappa$ R ($\rho$, T r) .

Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010)] with the addition of a cryogenic layer of deuterium-tritium (DT). These simulations show that a burn wave propagates radially from the magnetized hot spot into the surrounding much denser cold DT given sufficient hot-spot areal density.

@article{Slutz2010,
abstract = {The radial convergence required to reach fusion conditions is considerably higher for cylindrical than for spherical implosions since the volume is proportional to r2 versus r3, respectively. Fuel magnetization and preheat significantly lowers the required radial convergence enabling cylindrical implosions to become an attractive path toward generating fusion conditions. Numerical simulations are presented indicating that significant fusion yields may be obtained by pulsed-power-driven implosions of cylindrical metal liners onto magnetized ({\textgreater}10 T) and preheated (100–500 eV) deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel. Yields exceeding 100 kJ could be possible on Z at 25 MA, while yields exceeding 50 MJ could be possible with a more advanced pulsed power machine delivering 60 MA. These implosions occur on a much shorter time scale than previously proposed implosions, about 100 ns as compared to about 10 $\mu$s for magnetic target fusion (MTF) [ I. R. Lindemuth and R. C. Kirkpatrick, Nucl. Fusion 23, 263 (1983) ]. Consequently the optimal initial fuel density (1–5 mg/cc) is considerably higher than for MTF ( ∼ 1 $\mu$g/cc). Thus the final fuel density is high enough to axially trap most of the $\alpha$-particles for cylinders of approximately 1 cm in length with a purely axial magnetic field, i.e., no closed field configuration is required for ignition. According to the simulations, an initial axial magnetic field is partially frozen into the highly conducting preheated fuel and is compressed to more than 100 MG. This final field is strong enough to inhibit both electron thermal conduction and the escape of $\alpha$-particles in the radial direction. Analytical and numerical calculations indicate that the DT can be heated to 200–500 eV with 5–10 kJ of green laser light, which could be provided by the Z-Beamlet laser. The magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instability poses the greatest threat to this approach to fusion. Two-dimensional Lasnex simulations indicate that the liner walls must have a substantial initial thickness (10–20{\%} of the radius) so that they maintain integrity throughout the implosion. The Z and Z-Beamlet experiments are now being planned to test the various components of this concept, e.g., the laser heating of the fuel and the robustness of liner implosions to the MRT instability.},

Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

This converter works well, even to energies as low as 10 keV, because of its excellent space-charge handling ability. This low-energy operating range makes direct energy conversion possible on closed confinement devices; operation at about 100 keV might be useful on open confinement devices. Energy recovery efficiencies of 60 to 70{\%} are predicted. Examples are presented in which a direct energy converter with efficiencies in this range, when viewed as a topping cycle to a thermal converter, could considerably improve the reactor prospects of both open-and closed-field-line confinement schemes.},

abstract = {An acceptable criterion for strong sustainability in the consumption of natural resources is an effective, or virtual, limitlessness of supply, which can be defined, albeit arbitrarily, as corresponding to a few million years. The fuels for nuclear fusion - lithium and deuterium - satisfy this condition because of the abundance of lithium in seawater and of deuterium in all forms of water. The possible use of lithium-ion batteries on a large scale, particularly in the automobile industry, could, however, use up all the known terrestrial reserves and resources of lithium in the next few decades. Little attention has been paid so far to the financial, energetic, and above all, environmental aspects of lithium extraction from seawater. The neutron multipliers foreseen for fusion power plants, in particular beryllium, represent a major supply problem and require that other, sustainable solutions be urgently sought. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Once the third most ubiquitous substance in the Universe, to most people deuterium is either unknown or an arcane curiosity. But, as heavy water, it has a crucial role in the CANDU{\textregistered} 1 reactor concept. As an isotope of hydrogen, its separation from normal hydrogen is surprisingly easy but its extremely low natural abundance makes such separation relatively expensive. Accordingly, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) has worked extensively over the last 40 years on the development of the industrial processes with affordable economic characteristics. Three groups of processes attracted significant efforts and produced technically gratifying results. The most recent effort has brought a family of processes based on water-hydrogen exchange to industrial demonstration. They create potential synergies with industrial production of hydrogen, which many expect will become a major component of the energy systems of the 21 st Century. In the Beginning Deuterium provides part of the evidence on conditions at the Big Bang origin of the Universe. Only three simple substances are believed to have formed as atomic matter coalesced out of the primordial plasma: light hydrogen (or protium, to distinguish the common hydrogen isotope) constituted about 75{\%} and the balance was almost all helium. A mere 0.0013{\%} emerged as deuterium, the heavier and stable isotope of hydrogen 2 . Unlike all heavier elements and isotopes, the Universe's supply of both hydrogen and deuterium appeared once and for all. The stellar processes that create everything else are built from the hydrogen isotopes. But while a protium atom has relatively small risk of undergoing fusion inside a star, deuterium is completely consumed within seconds, a testament to its utility as a fuel for fusion. Now stars are not a major component of the Universe's mass and so have made little inroads on the deuterium content of the Universe since then but interesting local variations have developed. Small rocky planets like Earth have lost hydrogen to space rather prolifically. By preferentially retaining the heavier isotope, deuterium has become enriched to around 0.0155{\%} in Earth's oceans. (As much drier planets, Mars has attained almost 0.1{\%} and Venus a spectacular 2.2{\%} of the heavier isotope.)},

@article{Lindl1995,
abstract = {Inertial confinement fusion(ICF) is an approach to fusion that relies on the inertia of the fuel mass to provide confinement. To achieve conditions under which inertial confinement is sufficient for efficient thermonuclear burn, a capsule (generally a spherical shell) containing thermonuclear fuel is compressed in an implosion process to conditions of high density and temperature. ICF capsules rely on either electron conduction (direct drive) or x rays (indirect drive) for energy transport to drive an implosion. In direct drive, the laser beams (or charged particle beams) are aimed directly at a target. The laser energy is transferred to electrons by means of inverse bremsstrahlung or a variety of plasma collective processes. In indirect drive, the driver energy (from laser beams or ion beams) is first absorbed in a high‐Z enclosure (a hohlraum), which surrounds the capsule. The material heated by the driver emits x rays, which drive the capsule implosion. For optimally designed targets, 70{\%}–80{\%} of the driver energy can be converted to x rays. The optimal hohlraum geometry depends on the driver. Because of relaxed requirements on laser beam uniformity, and reduced sensitivity to hydrodynamic instabilities, the U.S. ICF Program has concentrated most of its effort since 1976 on the x‐ray or indirect‐drive approach to ICF. As a result of years of experiments and modeling, we are building an increasingly strong case for achieving ignition by indirect drive on the proposed National Ignition Facility (NIF). The ignition target requirements for hohlraum energetics, radiation symmetry, hydrodynamic instabilities and mix, laser plasma interaction, pulse shaping, and ignition requirements are all consistent with experiments. The NIF laser design, at 1.8 MJ and 500 TW, has the margin to cover uncertainties in the baseline ignition targets. In addition, data from the NIF will provide a solid database for ion‐beam‐driven hohlraums being considered for future energy applications. In this paper we analyze the requirements for indirect drive ICF and review the theoretical and experimental basis for these requirements. Although significant parts of the discussion apply to both direct and indirect drive, the principal focus is on indirect drive.},

	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {A new control module for the MAST-Upgrade Langmuir Probe system has been developed.   It is based on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA, which allows for excellent configurability and ease of retrieving data.   The module is capable of arbitrary bias voltage waveform generation, and digitises current and voltage readings from 16 probes.   The probes are biased and measured one at a time in a time multiplexed fashion, with the multiplexing sequence completely configurable.   In addition, simultaneous digitisation of the floating potential of all unbiased probes is possible.   A suite of these modules, each coupled with a high voltage amplifier, enables biasing and digitisation of 640 Langmuir Probes in the MAST-Upgrade Super-X divertor.   The system has been successfully tested on the York Linear Plasma Device and on the COMPASS tokamak.   It will be installed on MAST-Upgrade ready for operations in 2018.}
