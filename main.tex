\begin{abstract}
Novel divertor configurations are being explored as a possible solution to the heat exhaust problem in tokamaks.
Detailed knowledge of temperature and density in these divertors is therefore essential when testing the effectiveness of the heat mitigation provided by the configurations.
850 Langmuir probes have been installed in the plasma facing components (PFCs) of MAST-U however their analysis will be complex owing to the challenges associated with the sensitivity of flush mounted probes to field line incidence angles. 
Detailed 2 and 3 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are being carried out, using the particle-in-cell code SPICE, of a variety of different Langmuir probe tip geometries.
%which will allow for the reproduction of the probes in a prescribed plasma environment.
By simulating the voltage sweep of a probe in a prescribed plasma environment, the measured current-voltage characteristic can be compared to the expected temperature and density and modifications to the current Langmuir probe theory made to account for field line angle effects.
%This will lead to an improved model for the FMPs in MAST-U, and possibly a generalised improvement for any given Langmuir probe, which can be compared to the data taken during the upcoming physics campaign.
An updated model will be applied to the interpretation of flush mounted Langmuir probe data from MAST-U.
A further comparative dataset was taken on the linear plasma device Magnum-PSI in spring 2018, utilising a probe head from MAST-U's Divertor Science Facility.

%This will hopefully provide useful benchmarking data and/or validation for the data to be taken on MAST-U, thus improving the diagnosis of the super-X divertor configuration.

\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}

\subsection{\label{subsec:tokamaks}Tokamaks}
	Fusion is an attractive candidate for base-load commercial energy production due to its lack of greenhouse gas emissions, high power output, abundant fuel and lack of long-lived radioactive waste.
%	A Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel mixture must be heated to high enough temperatures to create collisions of sufficient energy to allow fusion to take place. 
%	The equation for this reaction is:
%	\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:DTEq}
%	{}^{2}_{1}D + {}^{3}_{1}T \rightarrow   {}^{4}_{2}He (3.5 MeV) + {}^{1}_{0}n (14.1 MeV)
%	\end{equation} 
%	The temperatures required ($\sim$ 200 eV for DT) will ionise the fuel mixture into a plasma, meaning that the individual charged components can be manipulated and confined by magnetic fields.
	One of the methods proposed for confining the fusion reaction is the use of magnetic fields, known as magnetic confinement fusion (MCF).
	This can be done using several techniques, the most widely used of which is the Tokamak; a toroidal magnetic device comprised of a combination of toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields in a helical shape. 
	This setup is being developed with the aim of a sufficient confinement time to allow net energy to be extracted from the fusion reaction and delivered to the grid.  
	
\subsection{\label{subsec:exhaust}The Exhaust Problem and MAST-Upgrade}
	A necessary consequence of the magnetic containment of a plasma within a vessel, such as a tokamak, is the existence of open field lines, i.e. field lines which impinge on surfaces. 
	Particles orbiting along open field lines will therefore impact on these surfaces, meaning these field lines create an avenue for heat \& particles to flow out of the plasma and be deposited onto surfaces.
	This can be helpful as it allows the removal of impurities - notably Helium ash, a by product of the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fusion reaction - however it is usually necessary to physically separate the impinged surfaces from the core plasma to reduce the flow of sputtered impurities into the core. 
	This can be done with either a limiter or a divertor\cite{Wesson2011}, with modern devices almost exclusively using divertors because of (a) the reduced sputtering of impurities into the core, and (b) access to H-mode - a mode of operation with higher confinement of particles in the core \cite{Itoh1989}.
	
%	  usually done with use of a divertor (\cref{fig:divertor}), where the targets are separated from the core plasma by a magnetic null point, or X-point.
%	The points at which the separatrix - the line separating the closed and open field lines - hit the target plates are called strike points.
%	These strike points will experience the highest heat and particle fluxes from the core plasma as particles cross the separatrix and flow towards the target through the scrape-off layer.
%	
%	Divertors have been used for decades with great success, allowing for more stable plasmas to be created. 
	However, when scaling Tokamaks up in size in order to produce a significant quantity of fusion reactions, the divertor target plates will experience very high heat fluxes because of the high core temperature required.  
	Dealing with and mitigating these heat fluxes is one of the key challenges currently standing in the way of commercial fusion power for toroidal devices\cite{Romanelli2012}. 	 
	
%\subsection{\label{subsec:mast}MAST-Upgrade}
	\begin{wrapfigure}[17]{rt}{8cm}

		\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{IllustrativeFigures/divertor.jpg}
		\caption{\label{fig:divertor}A diagram of the regions within a tokamak plasma, including the separatrix - the line separating the closed and open field lines - and the divertor, separated from the core plasma by the X-point.}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	A proposed mitigation technique for the heat exhaust problem is the use of divertor configurations which allow for reduced heat flux to plasma facing components (PFCs). 
	MAST-Upgrade (MAST-U) at CCFE has been designed as an experiment to test several aspects of divertor physics, namely the use of a closed divertor with Super-X capability \cite{Valanju2009}.
	The closed aspect of the divertor means that it is separated from the main chamber by a baffle, and therefore more effective at restricting the flow of impurities and neutrals into the core, improving confinement. 
	The higher neutral pressure in the closed divertor also enhances the amount of energy loss via radiation, dissipating the power hitting the target plates.
	The Super-X configuration reduces heat flux further by extending the plasma out radially, increasing both the size of the strike point, so the same power is spread over a wider area, and the flight time of particles in the divertor, allowing them to lose energy over a longer period of time.
%	Lower neutral pressure in the core results in higher confinement and easier access to H-mode.
%	A detached plasma should also be easier to access, which involves having an increased neutral density in the divertor which increases radiation of energy from the plasma before it hits the target.
%	\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{rt}{7cm}

%		\label{fig:mast_divertor}
%	\end{wrapfigure} 

%	The combination of the closed divertor and the Super-X should allow for more effective control of the heat flux to the divertor tiles.
%	It is therefore necessary to understand, with great detail, what goes on in the MAST-U divertor when it is tested experimentally to ensure that the models predicting the behaviour of the plasma are valid. 
%	We therefore require detailed measurements of the density and temperature of the plasma in this region, which must be gained through diagnostic techniques.

\subsection{\label{subsec:lps}Langmuir Probes and Flush Mounting}
	Langmuir probes are a widely used diagnostic in plasma physics to measure electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$). 
	In tokamaks they are limited to measuring plasma parameters near to the PFCs and the edge due to the extreme nature of the plasmas involved. 
	They are thus regularly flush mounted to reduce the incident heat flux to the probe tips and reduce erosion. 
	Flush mounted probes (FMPs) are however notoriously difficult to interpret in strongly magnetised plasmas \cite{Matthews1994}, notably because of the strong dependence on incidence angle of the magnetic field on the resultant shape of the current-voltage (IV) characteristic.
	
	At grazing angles of incidence, routinely found in tokamaks, sheath expansion becomes a dominant factor in the determination of the effective collection area ($A_{eff}$) of the probe \cite{Bergmann1994}. 
	Small uncertainties in the angle can therefore have large effects on the amount of sheath expansion experienced by the probe and therefore the shape of the IV characteristic.
	On top of this, magnetised probe theory is only valid when the projected probe extent is greater than the local Debye length and Larmor radius \cite{Gunn1995}. 
	The form of the IV characteristic, taking these effects into account, was developed by Bergmann\cite{Bergmann2002} and is as follows:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ivcurvesheathexp}
	\frac{I}{I_{i,sat}} =  1 + a |V|^{\frac{3}{4}} - \exp\left({-V}\right)  
	\end{equation}
	with
	\begin{equation}
	V = \bigg(\frac{e(V_p - V_f)}{k_B T_e}\bigg)
	\end{equation}
	where $I$ is the measured current, $I_{i,sat}$ is the ion saturation current, $V_p$ and $V_f$ are the probe and floating potentials respectively, $e$ is the charge on an electron and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. 
	Bergmann's, and later Murphy-Sugrue's \cite{Murphy-Sugrue2017}, contribution to this equation is the addition of a sheath expansion term, $a$, which takes into account the incidence angle of the magnetic field $\theta$. 
	It is of the form
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sheathexpparam}
	a =  \frac{c_1 + c_2  \cot{(\theta)}}{\sin^{\frac{1}{2}}{(\theta})} \frac{\lambda_D}{L + g}
	\end{equation}
	where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are coefficients of the lateral and frontal expansion of the sheath respectively, $\lambda_D$ is the Debye length of the plasma, $L$ is the length of the probe and $g$ is the size of the gaps either side of the probe.
	
	These issues have been previously mitigated on JET\cite{Monk1996} and DIII-D by angling the probe tip with respect to the incident magnetic field to increase the projected probe area and therefore lower the dependence on small changes of angle. 
	A similar probe tip has been designed for use in the divertor of the MAST-U tokamak at CCFE \cite{Harrison}.
	
\subsection{\label{subsec:motivation}PhD Project}
	As the area of the probe is essential to the calculation of the current density of the flux tube, getting measurements of $n_e$ becomes highly dependent on knowing the incidence angle and using this to calculate the area of the probe.
	This is also true for $T_e$, but to a lesser extent, as this is more dependent on orbits than small changes in collection area. 
	The main aim of this PhD project is to simulate the FMPs that will be used in the PFCs of MAST-U, using a 2D/3D3V particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code called SPICE \cite{Komm2011, Komm2013}. 
	These simulations are currently being run on the CUMULUS supercomputing cluster located at CCFE.
	Time has also been requested on the MARCONI supercomputing cluster hosted by Eurofusion\cite{Voitsekhovitch2018} to have an option of improved scalability.
	This is done with the aim of better understanding the IV curves produced in a wide range of conditions and therefore allow improvements to be made to the analysis model for MAST-U experimental data.
	Simulation results will also allow improvements to the current model of FMP analysis by extending the models into 3-dimensions - as advancements in supercomputing now allow for efficient computation of complex problems.
	This will allow for a more rigorous treatment of the probe tip geometry to be found than that found in \cref{eq:sheathexpparam} and therefore aid in generalising the analysis of FMPs.

\subsection{\label{subsec:benchmark}Benchmarking Murphy-Sugrue}
	The initial stages of the project called for familiarisation with SPICE and its benchmarking against previous simulations of FMPs done on the 2D3V code VSIM by Murphy-Sugrue \cite{Murphy-Sugrue2017a}.

		}
		\vspace{-20pt}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	My 1st year progress report describes that benchmarking simulations had been carried out of a 2D probe in the same geometry used in the bulk of \cite{Murphy-Sugrue2017a}: a flush mounted rectangular probe with small gaps either side (see \cref{fig:simulationmodel}, or my 1st year progress report for more detailed simulation parameters).
%	These had periodic boundary conditions on the left and right and a particle source across the top of the domain. 
%	The particle source is coded in such a way as to reinject particles leaving the domain to not disturb the temperature of the plasma.
%	The domain is simulated with parameters $T_e = T_i = 6eV$, $n_e = 6.85 \times 10^{18}$, $B = 0.413$T and $\alpha = 12.566$, where $B$ is magnetic field strength and $\alpha$ is incidence angle, in two cases; one with no-gap as in the simulations by \cite{Bergmann2002}, and one with gaps either side of the probe as in the simulations by Murphy-Sugrue \cite{Murphy-Sugrue2017a}. 
%	The `with gap' simulations have 0.48mm gaps either side of the probe, where the probe length is 2.38mm. 
%	The ion-electron mass ratio ($\mu$) is 900, there were 20 particles per cell and the domain is 822 x 372 $\lambda_D$ in size. 
%	Each cell is a square of $0.5 \lambda_D$.

	The probe was swept in voltage after 2 simulation cycles, which in SPICE are defined by the window traversal time for an ion.
	Current is measured as the voltage is swept, allowing an IV characteristic to be extracted.
	This IV characteristic was then fit with \cref{eq:ivcurvesheathexp}, performed using the least squares fitting function curve\_fit() (part of the optimise package in numpy). 
	The parameters extracted ($T_e, n_e, a, I_{i, sat}$) are the plasma parameters measured by a perfectly conducting probe with no capacitance effects.
	
	As previously reported, the comparison of gapped and non-gapped probes yielded the same overall conclusion of higher saturation current seen by the gapped probe. 
	This matches expectations as it has a higher collection area due to the additional edge exposed to the incident magnetic field, meaning a larger flux tube is subtended by the probe.
	However, the temperatures measured by the probe were anomalous, coming in $\sim20\%$ lower than the temperature specified in the input file. 
	This was thought to be because of a change in temperature across the simulation window, as seen by Murphy-Sugrue due to the loss of the high energy tail from the distribution function of the plasma not being replaced quickly enough by the injection algorithm.
	
\subsection{\label{subsec:injection}Velocity Distributions}
	An investigation was thus carried out into how the velocity distribution changed across the simulation window. 
	This was done through the manual creation of velocity histograms by binning all particles' velocity components parallel to the magnetic field. 
%	Components of velocity were taken parallel to the magnetic field.
%	There do exist built-in SPICE diagnostics for extracting velocity distributions but these were found to be inadequate for the measuring of temperatures due to a low particle count introducing lots of noise.
	Once histograms were compiled, velocities were denormalised into SI units and then fit with a Gaussian velocity distribution of the form:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gaussiandist}
%	np.sqrt(a / np.pi) * np.exp(-(a) * np.power(v - v_0, 2))
%	a = self.mass / (2 * self.temp_conversion * T_e)
		f(v) = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\alpha(v - v_0)^2\right) } \quad\textnormal{where}\quad \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{m_e}{2 k_B T_e}}
	\end{equation}
	where $f(v)$ is the one dimensional Gaussian velocity distribution function, $v$ is the velocity of a given particle, $v_0$ is the mean velocity of the plasma in the sampling region and $m_e$ is the mass of an electron.
	$T_e$ and $v_0$ were the parameters set to freely vary in the fit.
	
	\begin{wrapfigure}[20]{rh}{10cm}
		
		\vspace{-15pt}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{AllDataFigures/SpiceSimulations/Tests/distributionChange.png}
		
		\caption{\label{fig:distChange}Graph of the velocity distribution function of the electrons in the simulated plasma at 4 different locations: by the sheath entrance, at the injection area, and two points in between. The temperature, seen as the width of these Gaussian velocity distributions, decreases between injection and the sheath edge, which could account for the anomalously low temperature measured by the simulated probe.}
		\vspace{-10pt}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	Temperatures were measured from 4 equally spaced regions of the plasma in front of the probe: at the injection region, at the sheath entrance and two regions between (see \cref{fig:simulationmodel}).
	The distribution functions measured in each region (\cref{fig:distChange}) showed an increase in the flow velocity as the particles approached the sheath, which is to be expected, and a decrease in temperature by approximately $\sim 0.8$. 
	This explains the spurious measured temperatures from the benchmarking simulations of the probe as the assumption that the temperature of the plasma is uniform across the simulation window does not hold. 
	According to Langmuir probe theory \cite{Hutchinson2002}, the probe is sampling the temperature of the plasma at the sheath entrance. 
	Therefore in the analysis of all subsequent simulations the temperature at the sheath entrance - extracted from the fit to the histogram in this region - was used as the basis for comparison for the probe measurements, i.e. the probe temperature measurements were divided by the ratio between the fitted temperature at the injection region and the sheath entrance region ($\upsilon$)
	This does mean that the temperature seen by the probe is different from the temperature specified in the input file (by a factor of $\upsilon$), with profiling needed to be done to establish the exact relationship between these two temperatures if the probe temperature is to be specified in future simulations.

\subsection{\label{subsec:spicedevel}Spice Development}
	Following the investigation of velocity distributions, several changes were made to the SPICE source code to investigate further anomalous phenomena that occurred during simulations. 
	
	The first change made was to collect the velocities assigned to new particles by the injection algorithm and investigate whether any changes were being made by the source code before the particles were added to the simulation. 
	SPICE is purported to inject particles by sampling from pre-determined Maxwellian distributions, specified by the ratio of ion to electron temperatures ($\tau$).
	Phase selection is done carefully so as to ensure that particles aren't immediately removed from the simulation window by travelling across the top boundary through their Larmor orbits.
	This modification was done to ensure that the underlying injection velocity distribution function was as expected before any of the particles interacted with the potential in the simulation window.
	\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{lh}{10cm}
		
		\vspace{-10pt}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{AllDataFigures/SpiceSimulations/SamBenchmarking/FullGrid/Gap/PotentialResized.png}
		
		\caption{\label{fig:potentialstructures}Graph of the electrostatic potential around the flush mounted probe at the final time-step of the simulation. This is notable for the structures of large positive potential around the probe, which are anomalous and being investigated.}
		\vspace{-10pt}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	The source code was therefore edited to write the velocities of all injected particles to file in the first 100 time steps before they were added to the simulation.
	No significant changes from the specified Maxwellian were found.
	
	The second change was more substantial, and involved the extraction of simulation window parameters, notably electrostatic potential, at a number of points throughout the simulation.
	This was motivated by the observation of strange potential structures when looking at the potential of the simulation window taken at the end of the probe voltage sweep. 
	It is known that SPICE becomes unstable when the probe is strongly positively biased, so it was hypothesised that these structures (\cref{fig:potentialstructures}) were a product of this numerical instability. 
%	As SPICE is only able to output simulation window parameters for the final time-step, 
	In order to look at the potential structure around the probe at other points in the simulation than the final timestep, modifications to the code were required and have now been made.
	The analysis of the extracted data is still ongoing.
	
	Future plans for the development of SPICE during this PhD include porting these changes over to the SPICE-3 (the 3-dimensional (3D) version of the code), and also developing the code so that bespoke voltage waveforms can be used instead of just a linear sweep in bias voltage.
	
\subsection{\label{subsec:simscale}Simulation Scaling}
	In order to provide comparative simulations to the work done in \cref{sec:magnumprobes}, larger simulations of the entire probe tip were attempted in 2D. 
	However problems were encountered when trying to scale the simulation to the sizes required.
	The simulation can theoretically be scaled up to any size, but the time for the simulation will grow with the square of the scale factor\cite{Birdsall2005}.
	It is therefore necessary to find ways to either speed up the simulation or to parallelise the simulation further and reduce the wall-clock time.
	A bug in the version of MPI recommended for use with SPICE-2 was found to be limiting the parallelisability to 32 cores, which was fixed by upgrading MPI to a newer version.
%	One of the problems encountered with the latter solution was a bug with the version of MPI recommended for use with SPICE which did not allow for the splitting of computation over more than one node - limiting parallelisation to 32 cores. 
%	This was eventually fixed by upgrading the version of MPI to one which SPICE is not recommended to run with, and allowed the splitting of SPICE over 64 cores across 2 nodes - the most that SPICE2 is able to effectively parallelise.
	
	The other problem encountered was more fundamental; namely due to the way SPICE is normalised.
	As mentioned by Muphy-Sugrue\cite{Murphy-Sugrue2017a}, the accepted method of speeding up a Langmuir probe simulation is to change the length of the probe so it is shorter, but to simultaneously reduce the Larmor orbit radius ($\rho_{L,i}$).
	This has the effect of reducing the computation time since the simulation window is smaller, but maintains the same physics as the ratio between $\rho_{L,i}$ and $L$ is kept the same. 
	The reduction in $\rho_{L,i}$ is achieved by reducing the mass of the ions in the simulation, but this must be done in tandem with reducing $\lambda_D$, by raising the density of the plasma, so the ratio between $\rho_{L,i}$ and $\lambda_D$ is also conserved.
	The problem with implementing this method in SPICE is twofold: (a) the simulation is normalised to $\xi = \frac{\rho_{L,i}}{\lambda_D}$, so if the Larmor orbit is reduced in size, the subsequent change in $\lambda_D$ leaves $\xi$ the same and therefore SPICE runs the same simulation. 
	$L$ is also specified in units of $\lambda_D$ so the reduction in $\lambda_D$ counteracts any change in $L$, leaving the simulation exactly the same, except for the ratio of $m_i$ to $m_e$ ($\mu$).
	
	The second problem is that the ion mass cannot in fact be reduced, as changing $\mu$ in a SPICE input file increases $m_e$, thereby increasing the electron Larmor radius. 
%	This is done to 
	This was confirmed through a series of simulations utilising the SPICE particle tracking diagnostic and different methods of trying to reduce $m_i$. 
	Results from these simulations revealed that the ion Larmor orbit size did not change with different values of $\mu$.
	Other methods for running the simulations of interest within reasonable time frames are currently being explored.

	Measurements were taken on the linear device Magnum-PSI at DIFFER in Eindhoven, NL, using a 4-probe array designed for the Divertor Science Facility (DSF) at MAST-U with a range of control parameters including incidence angle of magnetic field. 
	A secondary goal of this experiment was to test that these probes performed as expected with regards to minimising sheath expansion and producing expected IV characteristics.
	The remainder of this section describes the experimental setup, analysis techniques used and subsequent results, ending with a discussion on the consequences of this for the interpretation of Langmuir probe data in MAST-U.
%	\begin{figure}[t] % Example image

\subsection{Experimental Method}
	The probe head used in this experiment was a 4-probe array designed for use in the DSF at MAST-U: a sample testing facility installed within the MAST-U divertor which facilitates the exchange of samples or electrical probes while maintaining vessel vacuum \cite{Elmore2012}.
	 
	This probe head has 4 Langmuir probes with tips of different geometry: a standard MAST-U tip, a tip with twice the geometric area of a MAST-U tip, a tip with half the area of a MAST-U tip, and a flush cylindrical probe with similar area to the standard probe. 
	(For reference these will be labelled M, B, S, and R respectively, taken from their designation in the Magnum beam-hall). 
	The first 3 probes are right-trapezoidal in geometry (\cref{fig:dsfprobe}) with the surface of the trapezium angled 10$^{\circ}$ relative to the divertor tile it is recessed into.

	The four probes are electrically isolated from each other by a PEEK pin holder, and the leading edges of the probes shadowed from plasma exposure by a graphite shell around the whole assembly. 
	The distances between the probes and the graphite shell were chosen such that the probe's leading edges are shadowed at incidence angles up to 10$^{\circ}$, the average expected operating regime of MAST-U in Super-X configuration \cite{Harrison}.	
	A specialised mounting assembly was designed and manufactured to hold the DSF probe head in place against the Magnum flat target holder (see \cref{fig:dsfprobe}).
	This target holder is water cooled and could tilt to give a range of magnetic incidence angles onto the probes.
%	The voltage sweep on the probes was produced by an Agilent 3312A arbitrary function generator, the waveform used was a 20Hz triangle wave varying between -100 and +10 V. 
%	This was amplified by a KEPCO 100-4M 100V bipolar operational power supply and applied to two of the four probes at a time. 
%	The current from the probes was measured by using a dual-channel isolational amplifier to observe the voltage drop across two 1$\Omega$ resistors. 
%	All of these signals were then digitised by a National Instruments NI PXI-5105 digitiser, with the voltage signal attenuated 10x to be sampled by the digitiser's 10V range.
%	The digitiser sampled at a minimum rate of 100kHz.
	
	The probes were prepared by vacuum bake at 200$^{\circ}$C for 5 hours, to minimise outgassing. 
	They were exposed to Hydrogen plasmas with a range of temperatures and densities, attempting to replicate the conditions within the MAST-U divertor.
	Due to the limitations of the source \cite{DeTemmerman2015a}, the temperatures could not be pushed higher than 3eV while maintaining low enough heat fluxes to prevent secondary electron emission from the LPs\cite{Stangeby2000}. 
	Densities were possible in a range from 2 $\times 10^{19}$ to 2.5 $\times 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$.
	The angle was varied in all cases between 0 and 10$^{\circ}$, which is the range of angles which are predicted to create challenges for probe interpretation in MAST-U.
	A neutral density scan was performed by increasing pressure in the target chamber using two controls: target chamber pump speed and neutral hydrogen gas puffing at the target location.	
	The plasma and target were also diagnosed with standard Magnum diagnostics: Thomson scattering (TS), infrared imaging (IR) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES).

	\end{wrapfigure}
	The TS measured plasma 30mm closer to the source than the probes, and the IR camera was focussed 20mm in the same direction: these measurements were therefore mutually exclusive (see \cref{fig:schematic}) so each set of plasma parameters had to be measured twice at two different axial positions.
	The probes were pushed into position by Magnum's TEAC delivery system for 5-15 seconds at a time with 5 seconds of traversal time either side of this stationary window. 
	
\subsection{DSF Redesign}

%		\label{fig:threeStageFit}
%		\vspace{-15pt}
%	\end{figure}
	A key finding from the experiment was the discovery of two design flaws with the DSF probe-head stemming from the choice of PEEK as the pin-holder material.
	Firstly, upon vacuum-baking it was evident that there was insufficient space between the graphite shell and the PEEK pin-holder to account for the difference in thermal expansion coefficient of the two materials.
	This led to the cracking of the graphite shell into 3 pieces.
	The design for the DSF has been updated, with the PEEK pin-holder being replaced with ceramic to prevent this from occurring.
	Secondly, the surface temperatures of the probes and graphite shell were high enough to cause the PEEK to melt.
	Molten PEEK then seeped into the gaps between the probes and the graphite shell, becoming exposed to plasma and burning. 
	This PEEK ash was then sufficiently electrically conductive that it created a short between two of the probes and the graphite shell, prohibiting their use until they could be taken out of the machine and the conductive material removed.
	The surface temperature of the assembly was much higher than it will be in MAST-U due to both the longer exposure times of the Magnum setup and the unfortunate existence of an exposed leading edge on the interface between the mounting device and the DSF probe head. 
	The latter was confirmed by the appearance of a hotspot on the IR camera of up to 1600$^{\circ}$C depending on incidence angle.
	Both of these will not be present when operating in MAST-U however, as the heat fluxes will be much lower, but the change to a ceramic pin-holder has also fixed this problem for future experiments on Magnum-PSI. 
	The leading edge on the probe mount will require modifications to the Tungsten back-plate to remedy in future experiments.

		\vspace{-15pt}
	\end{figure}
	Due to a fault with the Langmuir probe electronics, the most reliable data was obtained during the scan of neutral gas puffing - as such these results will be discussed in detail.
	These measurements were taken at an incidence angle of 10$^{\circ}$.
	The half area probe (S) is used in all measurements discussed as it was approximately in the centre of the plasma beam and did not short during the experiment.
	A low-pass Butterworth filter with a critical frequency of 4kHz was applied to the voltage signal to remove high frequency noise.
	
	IV characteristics were analysed using the 3-stage method developed on MAST \cref{fig:threeStageFit}.
	The full 4-parameter model was used throughout (\cref{eq:ivcurvesheathexp}), parameters being $T_e$, $I_{sat}$, $V_f$ and $a$.
	The ion saturation region of the IV curve is fit first to get an initial value for ion saturation current.
	This initial value of $I_{sat}$ is then kept fixed in a second, 4-parameter fit to the whole IV curve. 
	Finally, a full, freely varying 4-parameter fit is carried out, with initial values taken from the second fit, to get final parameter values and uncertainties.
	Comparisons were made between a 3- and 4-parameter fit and only small differences in the fitted value of $I_{sat}$ were found, which provides good evidence that the DSF probe tip's tilted design is successfully reducing sheath expansion effects at larger angles.
	Densities were calculated from the fitted parameters using the definition of ion saturation current $I_{sat} = n_e e c_s A_{eff}$, 
	%	\begin{equation}
	%	% Modified I_sat definition
	%	\label{eq:isateffective}
	%	I_{sat} = n_e e c_s A_{eff}
	%	\end{equation}
	where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $A_{eff}$ is the effective collection area of the probe - in this case taken as the projected area along the field line, found by extending the derivation of the exposed probe extent (in \cite{Harrison}) to right trapezoidal geometry.
	$c_s$ is calculated from $c_s = \sqrt{\frac{e(T_e + T_i)}{m_i}}$ and $T_e = T_i$ assumed. 
%	The form of $A_{eff}$ for probes S, M, and B, is then given by:
%	\begin{equation}
%	% IV Curve
%	\label{eq:a_eff_alternate}
%	A_{eff} = \frac{1}{2} \bigg(a + b - \frac{d}{\tan{\theta_{f}}} \bigg)\bigg(\frac{L}{\cos{\theta_{p}}} - d\bigg) \sin{\Big[|\theta_{\perp}| + |\theta_{p}|\Big]} + b \cos{\theta_{p}}\Big(d_{\phi}\tan{\theta_{\perp}} - d_{\perp}\Big)
%	\end{equation}
%	\begin{equation}
%	% IV Curve
%	\label{eq:d}
%	d = \frac{d_{\perp} - d_{\phi}\tan{\theta_{\perp}}}{ \sin{\theta_{p}} + \tan{\theta_{\perp}}\cos{\theta_{p}}}

	\end{figure}
	
	When comparing results from the LPs with $T_e$ and $n_e$ measured by the TS system, a systematic overestimation of temperature was found by the LPs along with systematic underestimation of density.
	Analytical IV characteristics were created from the TS data (\cref{fig:ivComparison}) approximating $V_f \sim 3 T_e$\cite{Stangeby2000} and calculating $a$ from \cref{eq:sheathexpparam}, substituting in Murphy-Sugrues values for the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ (although this made little difference to the overall shape of the IV as $a$ was very small in most cases).
	
	The density difference could be explained by a decreasing density profile along the magnetic axis of the beam between the TS laser and the probes, which is unfortunately difficult to verify as there is little available data about the axial profiles of density and temperature on Magnum-PSI due to the static nature of the available diagnostics.
	Preliminary analysis of the probe measurements taken in the 5 second traversal time either side of the stationary measurement window found there to be an increase of density as the probes moved into position, but further analysis would be required to draw conclusions about the exact nature of this profile.
	The temperature difference does not have a clear explanation, as great care was taken to ensure the 4-parameter fit was as good as possible - achieved by ensuring errors were not overestimated through reduced $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit testing and optimising the range of fitted data in voltage-current space.
%	Potential explanations of this finding could be found by challenging underlying assumptions: notably the electron-ion temperature equivalence which is at the core of Langmuir probe theory.
	The best current explanation is that the TS beam was not aligned properly down the centre of the plasma beam and was therefore providing an off-axis temperature reading, i.e. not measuring through the hottest section of the beam.
	Langmuir probes are however documented as being difficult to use on plasmas at temperatures on the order of a few eV\cite{Stangeby2000}, especially in noisy environments like tokamaks and linear devices, and this could be an explanation for the disparity of the temperature measurement.
%	Magnum-PSI is in the process of implementing a collective Thomson scattering (CTS) system which could, when working, provide a measurement of $T_i$ and validate the former point. 
%	The latter point is more difficult to validate, and would require greater plasma diagnosis closer to the FMPs (e.g. closer TS measurements).
%	It could also be the case that the temperature measurement is in fact correct due to some as-yet unknown plasma physics happening between the probes and the TS laser.
	
	Analysis of the density scan was conducted using the measured temperatures and densities and comparing their profiles to those measured by the TS system. 
	Saturation current density ($J_{sat}$) and parallel heat flux ($q_{\parallel}$) were also measured, with the latter using a value for the sheath heat transfer coefficient ($\gamma$) as 7.
%	Results show a continually decreasing temperature and density profile seen by the probes, as expected, but a roll-over in the TS density profile (\cref{fig:densityScan_Tn}). 
%	This rollover, along with the difference in position of the diagnostics, may indicate the movement of a detachment front up the beam as gas puffing is increased.
%	An explanation could be that as more gas is pumped into the chamber the plasma closer to the probes is more readily detached, causing the initial plasma density drop off seen by the probes. 
%	%	potentially because of the increased neutral density in front of the probe surface,
%	The plasma at the TS position requires more neutral density to see the drop off in plasma density take effect, resulting in the rollover of density at a higher value of target chamber neutral pressure.

%		}
%		\label{fig:densityScan_jq}
%		\vspace{-15pt}
%	\end{figure}
	The $J_{sat}$ and $q_{\parallel}$ profiles \cref{fig:densityScan_jq} show a continuous decline as neutral density increases, as would be expected due to the plasma-neutral collisions reducing the energy of plasma particles before they reach the probes.
	This could be considered an indicator of detachment and, if so, would be accompanied by an increase in radiation from the plasma in front of the probes. 
	This could be verified in further experiments.
	The delayed onset in the reduction of $J_{sat}$ in the TS measurements (i.e. further along the beam) may suggest the area of increased collisions is moving up the beam.
	Agreement can be seen between the probe and TS measurements of $q_{\parallel}$ at higher levels of gas puffing, however this is likely due to the overestimation of $T_e$ and underestimation of $n_e$ combining fortuitously.
%	This agreement also suggests that the high temperatures measured by the probes are physical and reduced to the normal levels by the decrease in heat flux due to neutral gas puffing.
	%	The values of heat flux are slightly higher than expected, as one would expect to find o, suggesting that the overestimation of temperatures is not a physical phenomenon but an issue with the interpretation of the IV curves.
	
	IR camera data is still pending thorough analysis, but could be used to verify the heat flux measurements.

\section{\label{sec:phd}Future Work \& Plan}

%\subsection{\label{subsec:simulations}Return to Magnum-PSI}
	The work carried out on Magnum-PSI, while fruitful, is incomplete.
	A further experiment has therefore been requested to complete the following goals: (a) carry out the investigation of incidence angle dependence on probe measurements, and (b) test the new design of the DSF probe head to ensure the previously uncovered problems have been remedied.
	For this investigation a week of beam time has been requested and the experiment will be carried out in collaboration with another PhD student at CCFE hoping to test the efficacy of a new diagnostic: coherence imaging spectroscopy.
	This will provide measurements of temperature and density to have a further diagnostic to compare probe measurements to. 
	It has also been requested that the electronics used in the previous experiment be re-used to minimise the introduction of additional noise or interference effects.

%\subsection{\label{subsec:experiments}JET Simulations}
%It has also been suggested that the justification for the
	Verification, with detailed simulation on SPICE, of the 4-parameter fit used in the fitting of FMP data on the Joint European Torus (JET) at CCFE is also planned for next year.
%	The model is used on all data regardless of magnetic incidence angle and verification as to whether the modified 4-parameter fit \cite{Gunn1995} would be useful for future probe analysis; both for JET and for MAST-U, as the angled probe tip design was based on the probes at JET.  
	This work will take the form of simulating JET probe tips under a variety of JET relevant conditions - most likely from looking at plasma parameters from high quality JET LP shots - and then comparing the simulation results to the IV characteristics in the JET database. 
	This will establish whether it was valid to use the 4-parameter fit in all previous JET data and advise on whether to continue using it, or alternatively the simplified 3-parameter fit, on upcoming campaigns.
%	The shots will be chosen based on how applicable the 4-parameter fit appears to be for that shot, with a range of highly suitable and unsuitable shots chosen.
%	This will hopefully give a good idea of whether the 4-parameter fit is (a) computationally reproducible, and (b) of limited use in certain areas of parameter space.

%\subsection{\label{subsec:}Conferences}

%\subsection{\label{subsec:timeline}Timeline for Remainder of PhD}

	The overall plan for the remaining 2 years of research, i.e. Dec 2018 - Sep 2020, has been drafted in \cref{fig:timeline}.
	\begin{figure}[t]

		\caption{A Gantt chart denoting breakdown of proposed work and milestones to achieve. Squares marked A denote the submission deadline for the respective conference abstract.}
		\label{fig:timeline} 
	\end{figure}
	This is not finalised but is intended to give an overall impression of the desired work and how long it will take. 
%	Three papers are intended to be published on the three overall areas of the PhD project: MAST-U LPs, JET LPs and Magnum-PSI measurements. 
	Two conferences are currently planned to be attended: plasma surface interactions (PSI) and the IoP plasma physics conference in 2020.
	I plan to present a poster at PSI, and as part of the conference I will utilise the opportunity to submit a paper for publication in the conference proceedings journal.
	Other conferences will be considered, such as the APS and EPS conferences in the US and Europe respectively, depending on available budget.
	A second trip to Prague for assistance in analysing SPICE data from larger simulations, is also planned for some point in the remaining 2 years. 
%	This will use the majority of my remaining conference budget, with further small conferences possibly to be attended if ad-hoc funding can be found.
